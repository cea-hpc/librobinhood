Well, I guess it\u0027ll just get out of use and I should start thinking of myself as old :-D\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id\u003d22283217\n\nAnyway, I\u0027m happy either way, letting Q decide :-)",

Good ol\u0027 printf debugging would probably have been faster... :P\n\nNothing to feel bad about here :)",
