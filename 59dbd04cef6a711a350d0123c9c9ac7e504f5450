I will update the ADR when I get the chance.\n\nOne important note: I realized that currently one cannot query fsentries based on stx_attributes (it wasn\u0027t the case before either, but with the new flags, it should). This stems from the way we store these attributes in mongodb. I have a pretty good idea how to fix it, just need the time to code it properly. I am giving up for tonight.",
