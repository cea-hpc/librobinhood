Is this right? And if so is that the behavior that we want?",

      "message": "Well, this may be a bit disturbing, but this value (`RRT_ANY`) is only used when pushing data in the ring.\n\nTo push data in a ring, we need to push in a ringr. As my ringrs are in an array (as you said, 0 for directories and 1 for fsentries), I did not want to write `ringrs[0]` or `ringrs[RRT_DIRECTORIES]` because they may lead to \"Oh, this is pushed to directories ringr\". This is why I decided on adding a fake index, with `RRT_ANY`.\n\nThe name may be wrong, `RRT_BOTH` can be a better candidate.",
