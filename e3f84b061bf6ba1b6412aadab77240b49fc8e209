I got the idea from here: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-labels.html#label_copyCondition\n\nThey give an example at the end of the section:\n\n\u003e copyCondition \u003d is:MIN OR -change-kind:REWORK OR uploaderin:dead...beef\n\nMight be that gerrithub\u0027s version of gerrit is not up-to-date enough, or I made a mistake somewhere... Or the feature is broken.\n\nThanks for looking into it 👍",
