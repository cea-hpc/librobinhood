      "message": "This is comparable to absolute vs. relative paths.\n\nThe difference is clearer when you start from a backend which is already a branch of another backend (not something that can happen fron a URI by the way).\nAsking to branch on \"/a/b/c\" is not the same as asking to branch on \"./a/b/c\" then.\n\nThis is where the ROOT_PARENT_ID comes from.\n\nWhether it is a good or bad idea is up for debate though.\nI think it could have its uses, but not sure if this breaks things along the way.",
