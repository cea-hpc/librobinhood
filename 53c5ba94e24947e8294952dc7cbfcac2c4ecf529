      "message": "This was introduced by 0cd27809545d4e786864c59958f7520ab0315bfb\n\nThis patch is a quickfix, it would be better to only allocate these structures once the first time and reuse them between calls to posix_iter_next. After looking quickly at the code, I don\u0027t see why the global variables where made local. But in case there is a reason, I left them local for now.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not a 100% sure, but I think it was because we said we didn\u0027t like global variables. However, since it\u0027s actually better to only allocate these things once, maybe we should indeed either move them back as global variables, or declare them `static` in the function.\nIn any case, I\u0027m ok with the change.",
